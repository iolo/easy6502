## Jumping

Jumping is like branching with two main differences. First, jumps are not
conditionally executed, and second, they take a two-byte absolute address. For
small programs, this second detail isn't very important, as you'll mostly be
using labels, and the assembler works out the correct memory location from the
label. For larger programs though, jumping is the only way to move from one
section of the code to another.

### JMP ###

`JMP` is an unconditional jump. Here's a really simple example to show it in action:

```6502   
  LDA #$03
  JMP there
  BRK
  BRK
  BRK
there:
  STA $0200
```


### JSR/RTS ###

`JSR` and `RTS` ("jump to subroutine" and "return from subroutine") are a
dynamic duo that you'll usually see used together. `JSR` is used to jump from
the current location to another part of the code. `RTS` returns to the previous
position. This is basically like calling a function and returning.

The processor knows where to return to because `JSR` pushes the address minus
one of the next instruction onto the stack before jumping to the given
location. `RTS` pops this location, adds one to it, and jumps to that location.
An example:

```6502   
  JSR init
  JSR loop
  JSR end

init:
  LDX #$00
  RTS

loop:
  INX
  CPX #$05
  BNE loop
  RTS

end:
  BRK
```

The first instruction causes execution to jump to the `init` label. This sets
`X`, then returns to the next instruction, `JSR loop`. This jumps to the `loop`
label, which increments `X` until it is equal to `$05`. After that we return to
the next instruction, `JSR end`, which jumps to the end of the file. This
illustrates how `JSR` and `RTS` can be used together to create modular code.
